              Since I wanted to create a SPA REACT felt like the obvious choice with its virtual DOM, also since REACT uses a compnent based design stucture,

              While I still wanted a minimalistic design with animated transitions,
              I didn't want the user to feel intimidated by complex UI/UX and tried to keep the UX as familiar as possible. This also makes it easy to adapt to all different kinds of screen resolutions.`}</span>
